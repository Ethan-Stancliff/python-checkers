# python-checkers
Pure-python implementation of checkers (draughts)
It's very basic ATM, however I plan to add a lot of functionality in the future.

Here's what I want to add in the rough order of when it should be added, this list may be incomplete and I may not get to everything
 - Optional graphical display using pygame
 - Engine support, including premade/trained and custom engines
 - Actual good documentation
 - Creating and uploading the package to pypi
 - Supporting custom variants
